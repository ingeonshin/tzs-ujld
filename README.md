Terminus: Zombie Survivors - Unofficial Japanese Language Data

1.Introduction

 Terminus: Zombie Survivors (hereafter T:ZS) - Distribute translation data in unofficial Japanese.
 - Download link (https://github.com/ststkuc-work/tzs-ujld/)
 - Links to unofficial Japanese language support (docs.google.com)
 - Compatible with V 0.9.8 Beta and Hotfix.
 - Translation data is unofficial. It has nothing to do with IngeonGames.

2.Overview

 If you set the language of the game to Japanese, all screen displays will be translated into Japanese, which will improve your understanding of the information and descriptions displayed on the screen.

 - Useful from the start of the game (current location) as the game progresses.
 - Avoid game over and achieve the end of the game (advance to the terminal entrance).
 - Increase expectations for the start of the next game by building on the success of the game experience.

 In addition, T:ZS is upgraded one after another, and data updates and new contents are added.
 We also deal with translation data in unofficial Japanese on a daily basis.

3.Translation Policy

 Do the following 1 ~ 7 of the things you can replace in translation from English to Japanese:

 1. T:ZS developer: Respect the world view of IngeonGames and work to get the most appropriate translation.
 2. Select appropriate expressions in accordance with the laws and regulations of Japan and the widespread understanding of society.
 3. Converting from English to Japanese, the in-game displays and explanations are in the Do/Do tone. Non-game displays and descriptions are unified in desu and masu tones.
 4. Proper nouns often used are expressed in full-width katakana. Change to half-width katakana characters when there is a limit on the number of characters displayed on the screen or when it is difficult to see duplicate characters.
 5. If there is more than one type of item, separate the names by - (nakaten (midpoint)).
 6. The description of the item should be placed on a new line in order to make it easier to see on the screen.
added.
 7. Good effects for players are indicated in green. Bad effects are marked in red.

 Finally, the parts that translation can't deal with are the parts of the T:ZS game where the system's functions and so on are used inside the game and built into the program.
 I would like to inform you that the translation is not inconvenient.

8.FAQ

 Q: Did you get official permission?
 A: I checked with IngeonGames and they gave me permission. There is no Japanese language support system, so we work informally.

 Q: Some parts have not been translated into Japanese.
 A: Where translation doesn't work is where functions of the system are used inside the T: ZS game and are programmed in.
    I would like to inform you that the translation is not inconvenient.

 Q: There is a free translation.
 A: Please send a better idea in the comments or to the Terminus: Zombie Survivors Japan channel "# Translate" on Discord (github.com).

 Q: I want to change the Japanese characters.
 A: In FontInfo.json, "Normal" = Normally, "Bold" = Bold as the Japanese font name of your choice changes the game's screen display.
    You can download your favorite Japanese fonts from Google Font (fonts.google.com) and Adobe Font (fonts.adobe.com).
